# artsy/hokusai

This orb is primarily built to share hokusai configuration across many CircleCI setups.

The bulk of the current implementation contains the PR release process, but other capabilities may be added in the future. See [Force's CircleCI config](https://github.com/artsy/force/blob/75c48fc8a7739b213ddb711480ced66139d6949a/.circleci/config.yml) for an example of how to use it.
